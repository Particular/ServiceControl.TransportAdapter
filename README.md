# Transport Adapters for ServiceControl

> [!WARNING]
> ServiceControl.TransportAdapter is obsolete. Use the [Messaging bridge](https://docs.particular.net/nservicebus/bridge/) instead.

Transport Adapter allows using ServiceControl
 * in mixed transport environments (e.g. part MSMQ, part SQL Server)
 * where advanced transport-specific routing features are used (e.g. RabbitMQ custom topologies)
 * in multi-broker environmers (e.g. multiple Azure namespaces)
